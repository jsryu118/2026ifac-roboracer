<p>International F1TENTH Autonomous Racing Competition is a racing competition open to teams of all levels. Competing teams may consist of any number of members; however, each participant should be a member of only one team.</p>

<p>This competition will be held as an in-person competition from August 24th (Sunday) to August 27th (Wednesday), 2026, at BEXCO in Busan during IFAC 2026 (The International Federation of Automatic Control).</p>

<p>F1TENTH Competition Schedule: August 24th (Sunday) ~ 27th (Wednesday), 2026</p>

<p>Teams can register for the competition through the official website.</p>

<!-- The preferred communication method with the organizers is the ICCAS2024 channel on [F1TENTH-teams Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/f1tenthxkorea/shared_invite/zt-1ibqf5yjq-CkG_z1XRhsZgBsCoSy7JiA). -->

<h3 id="2-competition-general">2. Competition General</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The competition consists of 5 phases:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Phase 0</strong>: Video submission demonstrating obstacle avoidance capability</li>
      <li><strong>Phase 1</strong>: Registration and inspection</li>
      <li><strong>Phase 2</strong>: Mapping and practice sessions (mapping, group practice, open practice)</li>
      <li><strong>Phase 3</strong>: Qualification (time trials)</li>
      <li><strong>Phase 4</strong>: Head-to-head race</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teams registered to the in-person competition need to provide and build a F1TENTH car by themselves according to the constraints listed below. In addition, each team must have a unique vehicle (i.e., a research lab may not field six teams with one car).</p>
  </li>
  <li>To increase the quality of the future F1TENTH competitions, the winner of each race is encouraged to publish the code of their algorithm under an open-source license in the <a href="https://github.com/f1tenth">F1TENTH repository</a> on Github.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="20-video-submission">2.0 Video Submission</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Teams must submit a video demonstrating obstacle avoidance capability before the competition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No specific format is required.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The submission must demonstrate the vehicle completing more than two laps on the track while avoiding static or dynamic obstacles.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Please adhere to the deadline.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="21-vehicle-classes">2.1 Vehicle classes</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Vehicle Class</strong> allows only cars that meet the following constraints:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The vehicle is constructed according to the official <a href="https://f1tenth.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/build_car/bom.html">bill of materials</a>. The teams are allowed to use components of similar or lower specifications.</li>
      <li>Each vehicle will be inspected as a part of qualification whether it meets the criteria. In case the criteria are not met, the vehicle cannot participate.</li>
      <li><strong>F1TENTH Competition is a battle of algorithms. Any hardware that should turn the odds in your favor is not allowed</strong>.</li>
      <li><em>Chassis</em>:
 Any chassis listed as <em>1:10 scale</em> car is allowed. Preferably <strong>1:10 Traxxas</strong> (e.g., <a href="https://traxxas.com/products/models/electric/ford-fiesta-st-rally">TRA74054</a>, <a href="https://traxxas.com/products/models/electric/6804Rslash4x4platinum">TRA6804R</a>, <a href="https://traxxas.com/products/models/electric/slash-4x4-tsm">TRA68086</a>), but generally, any chassis with similar dimensions is allowed. Both 4WD and 2WD are permitted.</li>
      <li><em>Main Computation Unit</em>:
 No limitations.</li>
      <li><em>LiDAR</em>:
 Both Hokuyo LiDARs with 0.25° or 0.125° resolution are allowed, as well as 30 m range LiDAR. In particular, 3D LiDAR is also permitted this time (however, please be aware that high-cost 3D LiDAR units may be damaged in high-speed race).</li>
      <li><em>Camera</em>:
 Both mono camera (e.g. Logitech C270, Logitech C920, Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2, Arducam) and stereo cameras (e.g. Intel Realsense, ZED) are allowed. Cameras that provide additional information such as detection or VIO results from onboard processing in camera are not allowed. (Depth information is allowed)</li>
      <li><em>Motor</em>:
 No limitation on spec. Only single motor can be used in power-train.</li>
      <li><em>Battery</em>:
 4s LiPo Battery or lower. Only one Battery or the combinations of lower-cell cells (Ex: 2s +2s is allowed).</li>
      <li><em>Tires</em>:
No limitations (Both sponge and rubber are allowed). However, chemical additives are strictly prohibited.</li>
      <li><em>Detection Box</em>:
The car has to be easily perceivable by the opponent’s LiDAR. Therefore, the car must occupy a space of size at least 12×12 cm at every horizontal plane between 10 to 30 cm above the ground.</li>
      <li><em>Foam Bumper</em>:
The bumper has to be soft to minimize the damage. These two components (Detection Box and Foam Bumper) must be attached if more than one car is on the track.</li>
      <li><em>Other sensors</em>:
Other sensors (IMUs, encoders, custom electronic speed controllers) are allowed. Indoor GPS sensors (e.g. Marvelmind) are not allowed.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="22-track--racing-environment">2.2 Track &amp; racing environment</h4>

<p>The competition will take place at BEXCO in Busan. The characteristics of the environment where the track will be built are:</p>

<!-- 1. The surface is flat and reflective. Therefore, LiDAR beams may reflect from the ground and measure the surrounding area rather than the ground. Similarly, depth cameras have problems with proper ground detection.
2. The room is surrounded by windows and “glass walls”. The windows will be covered by non-transparent material up to 50 cm from the ground to improve the perception. The room is bright, and the Sun can shine into it.
3. The track border is constructed from one air pipes of 33 cm diameters. They are made from aluminium and metal, secured with plastic/wodden holders. Keep in mind that there can be a gap between the pipes through which the LiDAR beams can pass.
4. The track will fit into the area of around the size of 25×10 m.
5. The track can be mapped in either the training sessions on each day or in the qualification session of each team. We are not providing a dedicated time slot for teams to map the track. Since many teams using SLAM algorithm or vision-based localization techniques, a dedicated **Map Creation** or **Mapping** session is not provided for the teams. -->
<ol>
  <li>The surface is flat and covered with rugs.</li>
  <li>The room is a segmented space that uses a gable wall for parts of the auditorium. Since there is no window on the wall, there is no external light coming in, and it is all composed of non-transparent materials.</li>
  <li>The track border is constructed from one air pipes of 50 cm diameters. They are made from polyester and metal, secured with cable tie and masking tape. Keep in mind that there can be a gap between the pipes through which the LiDAR beams can pass.</li>
  <li>The track will fit into the area of around the size of 20×10 m.</li>
  <li>We will allocate a <strong>mapping</strong> time slot for each team approximately for 5 minutes, depending on the scale of the competition.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="23-mapping--practice">2.3 Mapping &amp; Practice</h4>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Mapping</strong>: About 5 minutes for each team</li>
  <li><strong>Practice</strong>: Group Practice and Open Practice</li>
  <li>We will provide sample obstacles.</li>
  <li>The dedicated time for Mapping, Group practice and Qualification may vary depending on the number of participating teams.</li>
  <li>The dedicated time slots for the Mapping and Group practice sessions will be designated on a first-come-first-serve basis, and only teams that have successfully completed registration and inspection will be eligible.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="24-inspection">2.4 Inspection</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Inspection is to check that the hardware of the autonomous cars meets the competition requirements and the cars are not dangerous for the environment, opponents, and people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The car is supposedly built according to F1TENTH instructions, but alternative components may be allowed as long as they comply with the Rules. Any unclear or ambiguous points should be checked in advance with the race organizers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The team must demonstrate that it is possible to trigger emergency brake through remote human control (but not for intervening during the race!).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inspection of the vehicles is done on the first competition day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inspection is done by the race referees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inspection has to be completed before the Time Trials and after significant changes to the cars hardware or algorithms.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="25-qualification-time-trial">2.5 Qualification (Time Trial)</h4>

<h5 id="251-definitions">2.5.1 Definitions</h5>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Touching</em> means moving the object by less than 5 cm. Moving by greater distance is called <em>Crashing</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moving the track border by any distance is called <em>Crashing</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- 2. The track will contain several *checkpoints*, marked with a line across the track. Starting line is not a checkpoint. -->

<h5 id="252-general">2.5.2 General</h5>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Time Trials</strong>: The track is same for both practice and race. For 4 minutes out of the given 6 minutes (This may change depending on total number of teams.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Static Obstacles</strong>: One obstacle will be placed randomly in each obstacle area. (Each obstacle will be smaller than 0.5m x 0.5m). Position of obstacle will be open on the morning of Qualification day and will be fixed for all teams. Obstacles will be removed in the middle of the qualifying time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each vehicle must demonstrate that it can drive autonomously through a track without crashing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Algorithm reconfiguration/tuning should be done in only Pit-stop zone or out of track</strong> during the heat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The map (track layout) is <strong>known</strong> a priori and the track layout does not change over the whole competition. Keep in mind that cars crash into the walls and the layout of the track might slightly shift a little bit. Please consider this in your algorithms.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Two goals (two leaderboards)</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Fastest lap time</li>
      <li>Highest number of completed laps without crashing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Crash Handling</strong>: As long as the vehicle can continue the race without any intervention in the track, we do not check minor ‘touch’. Only when the vehicle severely crash the track needing manual (human) intervention, we invalidate that lap time and reset the count of completed laps.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="26-head-to-head-race">2.6 Head-to-Head Race</h4>

<h5 id="261-general">2.6.1 General</h5>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The Head-to-Head race is a race with two cars on the track at the same time on the same track but from opposite starting points.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The racetrack has the same layout as in the training and qualification sessions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The algorithms must not intentionally hinder the opponent or perform any damage to it. Specifically, manoeuvres such as deliberate crowding of a car beyond the edge of the track or any other abnormal change of direction are strictly prohibited. The referees will have the final say in whether a driver is in violation of the rule.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The head-to-head race will be organized as a knockout tournament with brackets seeded by results of the qualification. For example, with 8 teams, the bracket of the first round will be (#1 vs. #8, #2 vs. #7, #3 vs. #6, and #4 vs. #5).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each round will be played in two out of three games.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The starting position of the first game will be determined by the higher-ranked team in the qualifying round and then the losing team of the previous game will choose the position.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One head-to-head race consists of two teams racing against each other. One race has a dedicated timeslot of around 5 minutes. If one team is not showing up in these 5 minutes and let their car race, the other team won. If at some point along the race a car is not able to drive anymore (e.g. hardware issue, software not running etc.) and the teams are not able to restart the car withing the 5 minutes, the other team one the race. No time extensions are given and after the 5 minutes we move on to the next time slot and the next team.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each of the competing cars starts at its own starting line. Starting lines will be located at the opposite parts of the track.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Overtaking may be carried out on either the right or the left.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As opposed to time trials, no reconfiguration is allowed during the race, except after the crash, as described below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ultimately, organizers reserve the right to assign blame in the case of vehicle collision in the head-to-head tournament.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h5 id="262-requirements-for-qualification">2.6.2 Requirements for qualification</h5>

<ol>
  <li>The team has successfully completed the Time Trial.</li>
  <li>The car must be equipped with front foam bumper, e.g., <a href="https://traxxas.com/products/parts/7436">TRA7436</a> + <a href="https://traxxas.com/products/parts/7437">TRA7437</a> +  <a href="https://traxxas.com/products/parts/7415X">TRA7415X</a>. This solution is compatible with <em>Slash</em>. Model of <em>Ford Fiesta</em> already has this bumper.</li>
  <li>The car has to be easily perceivable by the opponent’s LiDAR. Therefore, the car must occupy a space of size at least 12×12 cm at every horizontal plane between 10 to 30 cm above the ground.</li>
  <li>The car needs to provide beforehand that is is able to avoid static and dynamic obstacles. This is evaluated by the race referess with a test:
    <ol>
      <li>The cars need to run 1 lap around the racetrack that includes static and dynamic obstacles</li>
      <li>These obstacles contain of size up to 35×32×30 cm, made from LiDAR perceivable material (e.g., cardboard).</li>
      <li>The racecars must show their ability to avoid those obstacles</li>
      <li>Based on this results the access to the race is granted.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="general-rules-for-qualification-and-head-to-head-race">General Rules for Qualification and Head-to-Head Race</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>All computations must be performed onboard!!</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No protests regarding Wi-Fi will be accepted.</strong> Please ensure that your autonomous system is designed to operate independently regardless of Wi-Fi conditions. You may ask teams not participating in the race to turn off their Wi-Fi, but this is purely to facilitate your team’s visualization and debugging, not related to algorithm integrity!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Strictly prohibit manual (human) emergency brake</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No data must be transmitted to the vehicle during the race.</strong></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h5 id="joystick-rules">Joystick Rules</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Joystick use or joystick pressing during the race is not allowed.</li>
  <li>Please change the code for autonomous &lt;-&gt; human control switching from “press and hold” method to “on/off” toggle method.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Joystick Exceptions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>At the start or re-start (for start)</li>
  <li>For emergency stop (e.g., after crash, reverse driving, remaining stuck in an obstacle for more than 5 seconds)</li>
  <li>For entering pit-stop zone on the manual drive zone for pit-stop</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="remote-computer-rules">Remote Computer Rules</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Computer (keyboard and mouse) use during the race is not allowed.</li>
  <li>Monitor can only be used for data plots or visualization through Rviz.</li>
  <li>Only one laptop can be connected for visualization (e.g., RViz) or debugging purposes.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Remote Computer Exceptions:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>When your car is out of track</li>
  <li>When your car is in pit-stop region</li>
  <li>When your car needs re-localization (only for giving initial-guess to your localization algorithm)</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="pit-stop-rules">Pit-stop Rules</h5>
<p>This is a designated zone for adjusting parameters without removing the vehicle from the track.</p>
<ol>
  <li>When the vehicle is in the pit-stop zone, you can use computer (mouse and keyboard) for parameter updates along with malfunction repair or re-localization.</li>
  <li>Joystick can only be used in the manual drive zone to enter the pit-stop zone.</li>
  <li>Do not manually drive with joystick when restarting from the pit-stop zone.</li>
  <li>Manual driving to enter the pit during head-to-head race must not affect the opponent vehicle in any way.</li>
</ol>

<h5 id="re-entering-rules">Re-entering Rules</h5>
<ul>
  <li>If the vehicle leaves the track for any reason, the vehicle must be placed back at the location where it crashed, although the vehicle’s direction can be slightly adjusted.</li>
  <li>This rule also applies when the vehicle stops for unknown reasons.</li>
  <li>This rule applies to both qualification and head-to-head race.</li>
  <li>Taking the vehicle to arbitrary locations (e.g., starting line) is strictly prohibited.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="hardware-maintenance-rules">Hardware Maintenance Rules</h5>
<ul>
  <li>Any hardware repair and maintenance inside the track is prohibited (not even in pit-stop).</li>
  <li>Examples: repairing broken parts, sensor recalibration, battery replacement, etc., all maintenance activities</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="264-penalties-and-warnings">2.6.4 Penalties and Warnings</h5>

<h6 id="1-lap-additional-penalty-cases">1 Lap Additional Penalty Cases:</h6>
<ol>
  <li>Complete rear-end collision</li>
  <li>Serious accident with major impact even if not a complete rear-end collision</li>
  <li>Fatal accident (spin or crash) due to any form of human intervention (physical interference, remote signals like manual brake or driving)</li>
  <li>Accumulation of 3 warnings</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Only one penalty per incident even if multiple violations are involved</em></p>

<h6 id="warning-cases">Warning Cases:</h6>
<ol>
  <li>Human intervention on your own vehicle during the race</li>
  <li>Interference with opponent vehicle during the race</li>
  <li>Violation of remote signal regulations (joystick, keyboard, mouse)</li>
  <li>Fatal accident (spin or crash) that does not warrant a 1-lap penalty</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Only one warning per incident even if multiple violations are involved</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Touching the border of the track or a static obstacle is not penalized. Excessive, repeated touching (up to the organizers) is considered a crash. (Same rules as for Time Trial.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Touching the opponent is not penalized unless one of the cars significantly diverges from its expected trajectory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Upon crashing the border of the track, the team has to fix the track and place the car on the side of the track at the place where the car first crashed the border. Then, the car can continue the race. During all of this, the opponent’s car must not be restricted by the team’s actions and the opponent is allowed to further race without stopping its car. The penalty is the time spent on fixing the track and placing the car.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Upon crashing the opponent, these steps are applied:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Referees judge which car is at fault and give a warning.</li>
      <li>Both cars are placed at the place decided by the referees</li>
      <li>The referees restart the race.</li>
      <li>If a team receives two warnings in a game, the team loses the game and proceeds to the next game.</li>
