<p>International ROBORACER Autonomous Racing Competition is a racing competition open to teams of all levels. Competing teams may consist of any number of members; however, each participant should be a member of only one team.</p>

<p>This competition will be held as an in-person competition from August 24th (Monday) to August 27th (Thursday), 2026, at BEXCO in Busan during IFAC 2026 (The International Federation of Automatic Control).</p>

<p>ROBORACER Autonomous Racing Competition Schedule: August 24th (Monday) ~ 27th (Thursday), 2026</p>

<p>Teams can register for the competition through the official website.</p>

<!-- The preferred communication method with the organizers is the ICCAS2024 channel on [ROBORACER GRAND PRIX-teams Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/f1tenthxkorea/shared_invite/zt-1ibqf5yjq-CkG_z1XRhsZgBsCoSy7JiA). -->

<h3 id="2-competition-general">2. Competition General</h3>

<ol>
  <li>The competition consists of 5 phases:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Phase 0</strong>: Video submission demonstrating obstacle avoidance capability</li>
      <li><strong>Phase 1</strong>: Registration and inspection</li>
      <li><strong>Phase 2</strong>: Mapping and practice sessions (mapping, regulated practice, open practice)</li>
      <li><strong>Phase 3</strong>: Qualification (time trials)</li>
      <li><strong>Phase 4</strong>: Head-to-head race</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teams registered to the in-person competition need to provide and build a car by themselves according to the constraints listed below. In addition, each team must have a unique vehicle (i.e., a research lab may not field six teams with one car).</p>
  </li>
  <li>To enhance the quality of future ROBORACER Autonomous Racing competitions, winners of each race are encouraged to release their algorithm code under an open-source license in the <a href="https://github.com/f1tenth">ROBORACER Autonomous Racing Community repository</a> on GitHub.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="20-video-submission">2.0 Video Submission</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Teams must submit a video demonstrating obstacle avoidance capability before the competition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No specific format is required.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The submission must demonstrate the vehicle completing <strong>more than two laps</strong> on the track while <strong>avoiding static or dynamic obstacles</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Please adhere to the deadline.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="21-inspection">2.1 Inspection</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The purpose of the Inspection is to check that the hardware of the autonomous cars meets the competition requirements and the cars are not dangerous for the environment, opponents, and people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The car is supposedly built according to instructions, but alternative components may be allowed as long as they comply with the <strong>Rules</strong>. Any unclear or ambiguous points should be checked <strong>in advance</strong> with the race organizers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The team must demonstrate that it is possible to trigger emergency brake through remote human control (<strong>but not for intervening during the race!</strong>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The dedicated time slots for the Mapping and Regulated practice sessions will be designated on a <strong>first-come-first-serve basis</strong>, and only teams that have successfully <strong>completed registration</strong> and <strong>inspection</strong> will be eligible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inspection of the vehicles is done on the first competition day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inspection is done by the race referees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The inspection has to be completed before the Time Trials and after significant changes to the cars hardware or algorithms.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Vehicle Class</strong> allows only cars that meet the following constraints:</p>

    <p><!-- 1. The vehicle is constructed according to the official [bill of materials](https://f1tenth.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/build_car/bom.html). The teams are allowed to use components of similar or lower specifications. --></p>

    <ol>
      <li>Each vehicle will be inspected as a part of qualification whether it meets the criteria. In case the criteria are not met, the vehicle cannot participate.</li>
      <li><strong>The ROBORACER Autonomous Racing Competition emphasizes algorithmic performance. Hardware designed to provide an unfair advantage is strictly prohibited.</strong>.</li>
      <li><em>Chassis</em>:
 Any chassis listed as <em>1:10 scale</em> car is allowed. Preferably <strong>1:10 Traxxas</strong> (e.g., <a href="https://traxxas.com/products/models/electric/ford-fiesta-st-rally">TRA74054</a>, <a href="https://traxxas.com/products/models/electric/6804Rslash4x4platinum">TRA6804R</a>, <a href="https://traxxas.com/products/models/electric/slash-4x4-tsm">TRA68086</a>), but generally, any chassis within 15% of the Traxxas cars’ dimensions is allowed (238mm ≤ Width ≤ 341mm, 454 mm ≤ Length ≤ 654mm). Both 4WD and 2WD are permitted.</li>
      <li><em>Tires</em>:
 <strong>No limitations</strong> (Both sponge and rubber are allowed). However, <strong>chemical additives are strictly prohibited</strong>.</li>
      <li><em>Motor</em>:
 <strong>No limitations</strong> on spec. Only single motor can be used in power-train.</li>
      <li><em>Battery</em>:
 <strong>4s LiPo Battery</strong> or <strong>lower</strong>. Only one Battery or the combinations of lower-cell cells (Ex: 2s + 2s is allowed).</li>
      <li><em>Detection Box</em>:
 The car has to be easily perceivable by the opponent’s LiDAR. Therefore, the car must occupy a space of size at least 12×12 cm at every horizontal plane between <strong>10 to 30 cm</strong>above the ground.</li>
      <li><em>Foam Bumper</em>:
 The bumper has to be soft to minimize the damage. These two components (Detection Box and Foam Bumper) must be attached if more than one car is on the track.</li>
      <li><em>Main Computation Unit</em>:
 <strong>No limitations</strong>.</li>
      <li><em>LiDAR</em>:
Both Hokuyo LiDARs with <strong>0.25° or 0.125°</strong> resolution are allowed, as well as 30 m range LiDAR. In particular, <strong>3D LiDAR</strong> is also permitted this time (however, please be aware that high-cost 3D LiDAR units may be damaged in high-speed race).</li>
      <li><em>Camera</em>:
Both <strong>mono camera</strong> (e.g. Logitech C270, Logitech C920, Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2, Arducam) and <strong>stereo cameras</strong> (e.g. Intel Realsense, ZED) are allowed. Cameras that provide additional information such as <strong>detection or VIO results</strong> from onboard processing in camera are <strong>not allowed</strong>. (Depth information is allowed)</li>
      <li><em>Other sensors</em>:
Other sensors (IMUs, encoders, custom electronic speed controllers) are allowed. Indoor GPS sensors (e.g. Marvelmind) <strong>are not allowed</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="22-track--racing-environment">2.2 Track &amp; racing environment</h4>

<p>The competition will take place at BEXCO in Busan. The characteristics of the environment where the track will be built are:</p>

<!-- 1. The surface is flat and reflective. Therefore, LiDAR beams may reflect from the ground and measure the surrounding area rather than the ground. Similarly, depth cameras have problems with proper ground detection.
2. The room is surrounded by windows and “glass walls”. The windows will be covered by non-transparent material up to 50 cm from the ground to improve the perception. The room is bright, and the Sun can shine into it.
3. The track border is constructed from one air pipes of 33 cm diameters. They are made from aluminium and metal, secured with plastic/wodden holders. Keep in mind that there can be a gap between the pipes through which the LiDAR beams can pass.
4. The track will fit into the area of around the size of 25×10 m.
5. The track can be mapped in either the training sessions on each day or in the qualification session of each team. We are not providing a dedicated time slot for teams to map the track. Since many teams using SLAM algorithm or vision-based localization techniques, a dedicated **Map Creation** or **Mapping** session is not provided for the teams. -->

<!-- 1. The surface is flat and covered with rugs. 
2. The room is a segmented space that uses a gable wall for parts of the auditorium. Since there is no window on the wall, there is no external light coming in, and it is all composed of non-transparent materials.
3. The track border is constructed from one air pipes of 50 cm diameters. They are made from polyester and metal, secured with cable tie and masking tape. Keep in mind that there can be a gap between the pipes through which the LiDAR beams can pass.
4. The track will fit into the area of around the size of 20×10 m.
5. We will allocate a **mapping** time slot for each team approximately for 5 minutes, depending on the scale of the competition. -->
