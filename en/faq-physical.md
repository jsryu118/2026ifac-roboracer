# Mechanics

- Is it allowed to use different tires than those coming with the car?

  Yes, it is allowed. According to the rules, there are no limitations on tires (both sponge and rubber are allowed).
  However, chemical additives are strictly prohibited.



- Is there an upper weight limit in the "Vehicle Class"?

  No.

- Are we allowed to add extra (otherwise non-functional) weights (e.g.
  a small steel plate) to improve the traction of the car?

  The only non-functional weight allowed is to equally balance the car
  wheels. This weight must be statically mounted on the car.

- Are we allowed to change the transmission gear ratio of our cars?

  Yes. 
  Hardware modifications, including the transmission gear ratio, are allowed as long as they comply with the general rules. The ROBORACER Autonomous Racing Competition emphasizes algorithmic performance. Teams are encouraged to focus on optimizing their software.

# Sensors

- What cameras can be mounted on the vehicle?

  According to the rules, both mono cameras and stereo cameras are allowed. However, **cameras that provide additional information such as detection or VIO results from onboard processing are not allowed**. (Depth information is allowed)
  
  **Not permitted:**
  - [Intel Realsense T265](https://www.intelrealsense.com/tracking-camera-t265/): has embedded VIO/SLAM algorithms that directly provide 6DoF pose tracking results
  
  **Permitted:**
  - [Intel Realsense L515](https://www.intelrealsense.com/lidar-camera-l515/)
  - [Intel Realsense D455](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d455/)
  - [Stereolabs ZED 2i](https://www.stereolabs.com/zed-2i/)


# Rules

- How will you signal the start of a race?

  For time trials you can start as soon as you are ready. Time
  measurement will start once you cross the starting line.

  For head to head, the stewards will yell "ready-set-go".
