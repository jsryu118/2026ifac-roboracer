# 1. Overview

The International ROBORACER Autonomous Racing Competition is a racing event open to teams of all levels. Teams may consist of any number of members; however, each participant must be **a member of only one team**.

This competition will be held as an in-person competition from **August 24 (Monday)** to **August 27 (Thursday)**, **2026**, at **BEXCO** in Busan during **IFAC 2026**.

**ROBORACER GRAND PRIX Schedule: August 24 (Monday) to 27 (Thursday), 2026**

Teams may **register** for the competition through the **official website**.


# 2. Competition General

1. The competition consists of five phases:
   - **Phase 0**: Submission of technical materials related to the team's autonomous driving
   - **Phase 1**: Registration and inspection
   - **Phase 2**: Mapping and practice sessions (mapping, official practice, free practice)
   - **Phase 3**: Qualification (Mission Execution, Time Trial)
   - **Phase 4**: Head-to-Head Race

2. Teams registered for in-person competition must provide and build their own vehicles according to the constraints listed below. In addition, each team must have a unique vehicle (i.e., one lab cannot enter multiple teams with a single vehicle).

3. To improve the quality of future ROBORACER competitions, winners of each race are encouraged to open-source their algorithm code under an open-source license in the [ROBORACER Autonomous Racing Community repository](https://github.com/f1tenth) on GitHub.

## 2.0 Technical Materials Submission

1. Teams shall submit technical materials regarding their vehicle during the pre-competition registration process.

2. No specific format is required.

3. The submission must include a summary of the **software and hardware technology** of the team's autonomous vehicle.

4. Please observe the deadline.


## 2.1 Vehicle Class
**Vehicle Class** only allows vehicles that meet the following constraints:

1. Vehicles must be built according to ROBORACER guidelines, but alternative parts may be allowed as long as they comply with regulations. Unclear or ambiguous items must be confirmed in advance with race organizers.
2. Each vehicle is inspected as part of qualifying to determine if it meets criteria. If criteria are not met, the vehicle cannot participate.
3. **The ROBORACER competition is an algorithm competition. Hardware that confers an advantage is not permitted.**
4. _Chassis_:
    The race is designed for **1:10 Traxxas** chassis (e.g., TRA74054, TRA6804R). While these chassis are recommended, chassis generally within 15% of Traxxas vehicle dimensions are allowed (238mm <= width <= 341mm, 454mm <= length <= 654mm). Both **4WD and 2WD** are allowed.
5. _Tires_:
    **No restriction** (both sponge and rubber are permitted). However, **chemical additives are strictly prohibited**.
6. _Main computing unit_:
    **No restriction** on specifications. Only one computing unit may be used.
7. _LiDAR_:
    **No restriction** on specifications. Only one LiDAR sensor may be used. **3D LiDAR** is also permitted.
8. _Camera_:
    Both a **single camera** (e.g., Logitech C270, Logitech C920, Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2, Arducam) and a **stereo camera** (e.g., Intel Realsense, ZED) are permitted. Cameras that provide additional information via onboard processing, such as **detection or VIO results**, are **not permitted**. (Depth information is allowed.)
9. _Motor_:
    **No restriction** on specifications. Only a **single motor** may be used for the powertrain.
10. _Battery_:
    **4S LiPo battery** or **3S or lower**. There is no limit on the number of batteries, as long as the total cell count does not exceed 4S (e.g., 2S + 2S is allowed).
11. _Detection box_:
    The vehicle must be easily detected by the opponent's LiDAR. Therefore, the vehicle must occupy a space of at least **12 x 12 cm** in any horizontal plane between **10 and 30 cm** above the ground.
12. _Foam bumper_:
    The bumper must be soft to minimize damage. If two or more vehicles are on the track, these two components (Detection box and foam bumper) must be attached.
13. _Other sensors_:
    Other sensors (IMU, encoders, custom electronic speed controllers) are allowed. Indoor GPS sensors (e.g., Marvelmind) are **not allowed**.

## 2.2 Track and Race Environment

The competition will be held at BEXCO in Busan. The characteristics of the environment in which the track will be constructed are as follows:
<center>
<img src="../images/environment/bexco_hall_1.jpg"  style="width: 25vw" />
</center>
The floor of [BEXCO Exhibition Center 2, 3rd Floor, Hall 5A](https://www.bexco.co.kr/eng/CMS/Contents/Contents.do?mCode=MN040), where the track will be installed, is hardened concrete with a urethane coating finish. This surface is characterized by a significantly lower friction coefficient compared to typical asphalt pavement and is notably smooth. ⚠️ **Caution: The surface is slippery.**

The track dimensions are approximately **8 m × 22 m**.

## 2.3 Inspection

- The purpose of inspection is to verify that the hardware of the autonomous vehicle meets competition requirements and does not pose a risk to the environment, opponents, or people.

- Vehicles must be built according to ROBORACER guidelines, but alternative parts may be allowed as long as they comply with regulations.

- Teams must demonstrate that they can activate the emergency brake via a toggle method (however, **this may not be used for intervention during the race**!).

- Vehicle inspection will be conducted on the first day of the competition.

- Inspections are performed by the race referees.

- Inspection must be completed **before the Time Trial** and **after any significant changes** to the vehicle's hardware or algorithm.

## 2.4 Mapping and Practice

### 2.4.1 Mapping
- Approximately 3 minutes are allocated to each team.
- This time is exclusive use of the entire track for a single team.
- This time may be used for mapping, data collection, and practice.
- If a team does not arrive at its designated time slot, the opportunity is forfeited and no additional time will be provided.
- Each team may prepare multiple vehicles and use them on the track.
- Teams without a map file may obtain one from nearby teams, but this is outside the responsibility of the organizers.
- For this competition, png and yaml files for the track will be provided.

### 2.4.2 Practice
- Each team may prepare multiple vehicles, but only one vehicle per team may be on the track.
- Sample obstacles will be provided.
- The organizers do not assume responsibility for accidents during practice.
- However, the team involved in an accident is obligated to explain its algorithm at the request of the referees.

<!--needs update-->
### 2.5.1 General
- Practice and qualifying use the same track.
- All stages of qualifying must be completed **within 8 minutes**.
    - This may change depending on the total number of participating teams.
- Qualifying consists of **three missions** (**Q1, Q2, Q3**) and **one achievement condition** called **Fully Autonomous**.
- Q1 through Q3 are conducted sequentially and may not be skipped.
- Final ranking in qualifying is determined in the following order:
    - Fully Autonomous satisfaction
    - Number of qualifying rounds passed
    - Record of the most recently completed qualifying round
- An example of final ranking determination is as follows:
    - Assume there are 12 teams in total.
    - Assume that 3 teams pass each of Q1, Q2, Q3, and 3 teams satisfy Fully Autonomous.
    - Among teams that satisfy Fully Autonomous, assign places 1 through 3 in order of Q3 record.
    - Among teams that pass Q3, assign places 4 through 6 in order of Q3 record.
    - Repeat in the same manner down to Q1.

- If two or more vehicles may be on the track, the Detection box must be attached. (e.g., it is not required during mapping or qualifying.)
- **No objections regarding Wi-Fi will be accepted.** Please ensure that your autonomous driving system is designed to operate independently of Wi-Fi conditions. While we will request that non-participating teams turn off Wi-Fi, this is solely to facilitate visualization and debugging for teams, not to improve algorithm performance!
- All hardware repair and maintenance on the track (repairing damaged parts, sensor recalibration, battery replacement, etc.) is prohibited.
- Dedicated times for **mapping**, **official practice**, and **qualifying** may vary depending on the number of participating teams.
- Dedicated times for **mapping** and **official practice** are assigned on a **first-come, first-served** basis, and only teams that have **successfully completed registration and inspection** are eligible.
- It is prohibited for people to be on the track. (Except during mapping time.)
- Joystick **use** or **pressing** is **not permitted** during the race.
    - Please change the module for switching between autonomous driving and human control from a "**press and hold**" method to an "**on/off**" **toggle** method.
- Only one laptop may be connected for visualization (e.g., RViz) or debugging purposes.
- If a vehicle is stopped too close to the obstacle ahead (opponent vehicle or static obstacle) such that an avoidance maneuver is impossible and space is needed, the referees may move it slightly backward upon request.
